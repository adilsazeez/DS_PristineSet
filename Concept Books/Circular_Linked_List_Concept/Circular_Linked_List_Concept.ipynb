    "### What is Circular Linked List?\n",
    "\n",
    "Circular linked list is a variation of linked list where all nodes are connected to form a circle. There is no NULL at the end. A circular linked list can be a singly circular linked list or doubly circular linked list.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Circular Linked List?\n",
    "\n",
    "- With a circular linked list, a pointer to the tail node gives easy access also to the first node, by following one link. Thus, in applications that require access to both ends of the list (e.g., in the implementation of a queue), a circular structure allows one to handle the structure by a single pointer, instead of two.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Any node can be a starting point. We can traverse the whole list by starting from any point. We just need to stop when the first visited node is visited again.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Idea?\n",
    "\n",
    "The circular linked list is the collection of nodes in which tail node also point back to head node. The diagram shown below depicts a circular linked list. So, in this list, A is pointing to B, B is pointing to C and C is pointing to D but what makes it circular is that node D is pointing back to node A.\n",
