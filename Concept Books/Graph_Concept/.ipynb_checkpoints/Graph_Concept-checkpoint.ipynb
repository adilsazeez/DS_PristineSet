    "### What is Graph?\n",
    "\n",
    "A graph is a pictorial representation of a set of objects where some pairs of objects are connected by links. The interconnected objects are represented by points termed as vertices or nodes, and the links that connect the vertices or nodes are called edges.\n",
    "\n",
    "A graph is a pair of sets (V, E), where V is the set of vertices and E is the set of edges, connecting the pairs of vertices. Take a look at the following graph −\n",

    "### Why Graph?\n",
    "\n",
    "We use graphs for numerous things, such as representing networks of communication, data organization, computational devices, flow of computation, etc. We can represent website link structures as directed graphs (digraph — graph in which edges have directions) where vertices represent web pages and the directed edges represent links from one page to another.\n",

    "To implement graph in python we will use dictionary data structure in python. \n",
    "The keys of the dictionary used are the nodes of our graph and the corresponding values are lists with each nodes, which are connecting by an edge. \n"
