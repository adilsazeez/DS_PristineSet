    "### What is Circular Queue?\n",
    "\n",
    "Circular Queue is a linear data structure in which the operations are performed based on FIFO (First In First Out) principle and the last position is connected back to the first position to make a circle. It is also called ‘Ring Buffer’. \n",
    "In a normal Queue, we can insert elements until queue becomes full. But once queue becomes full, we can not insert the next element even if there is a space in front of queue. (Source: GeeksforGeeks)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Circular Queue?\n",
    "\n",
    "Circular Queues offer a quick and clean way to store FIFO data with a maximum size.\n",
    "- Doesn’t use dynamic memory → No memory leaks\n",
    "- Conserves memory as we only store up to our capacity (opposed to a queue which could continue to grow if input outpaces output.)\n",
    "- Simple Implementation → easy to trust and test\n",
    "- Never has to reorganize / copy data around\n",
    "- All operations occur in constant time O(1)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Idea?\n",
    "\n",
    "A Queue is a simple data structure that implements the FIFO (First-In-First-Out) ordering. This simply means that the first item added to your queue is the first one out. Just like a line or queue of customers at the deli, the first customer in line is the first to be served. A circular queue is essentially a queue with a maximum size or capacity which will continue to loop back over itself in a circular motion.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1znHpIsh7Fe_KpkVyaLsZTjQDalM6fFU0\" align='center' />\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The above GIF depicts a circular queue representation that is implemented like a ring buffer.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1NMOKPcPgSnNGAR99RfS02CY8Bapemxy3\" align='center' />\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's another example that shows the change of control from the last position back to the first position to implement the circular queue functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a video of one more example. The video explains the workings of the Circular Queue Data Structure in a more generic way."
