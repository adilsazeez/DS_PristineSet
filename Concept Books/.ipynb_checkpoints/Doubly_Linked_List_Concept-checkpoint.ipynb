    "### What is Doubly Linked List?\n",
    "\n",
    "In computer science, a doubly linked list is a linked data structure that consists of a set of sequentially linked records called nodes. Each node contains three fields: two link fields (references to the previous and to the next node in the sequence of nodes) and one data field. The beginning and ending nodes' previous and next links, respectively, point to some kind of terminator, typically a sentinel node or null, to facilitate traversal of the list. If there is only one sentinel node, then the list is circularly linked via the sentinel node. It can be conceptualized as two singly linked lists formed from the same data items, but in opposite sequential orders. (Source: Wikipedia)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Doubly Linked List?\n",
    "\n",
    "- A DLL can be traversed in both forward and backward direction.\n",
    "- The delete operation in DLL is more efficient if pointer to the node to be deleted is given.\n",
    "- We can quickly insert a new node before a given node.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Idea?\n",
    "\n",
    "Doubly Linked List is a variation of Linked list in which navigation is possible in both ways, either forward and backward easily as compared to Single Linked List.\n",
