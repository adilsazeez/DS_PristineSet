    "### What is Linked List?\n",
    "\n",
    "In computer science, a linked list is a linear collection of data elements whose order is not given by their physical placement in memory. Instead, each element points to the next. It is a data structure consisting of a collection of nodes which together represent a sequence. In its most basic form, each node contains: data, and a reference (in other words, a link) to the next node in the sequence. This structure allows for efficient insertion or removal of elements from any position in the sequence during iteration. More complex variants add additional links, allowing more efficient insertion or removal of nodes at arbitrary positions. A drawback of linked lists is that access time is linear (and difficult to pipeline). Faster access, such as random access, is not feasible. Arrays have better cache locality compared to linked lists. (Source: Wikipedia)\n",

    "### Why Linked List?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Linked List is Dynamic data Structure .\n",
    "\n",
    "- Linked List can grow and shrink during run time.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Insertion and Deletion Operations are Easier\n",
    "\n",
    "- Efficient Memory Utilization ,i.e no need to pre-allocate memory\n",
    "\n",
    "- Faster Access time,can be expanded in constant time without memory overhead\n",
    "\n",
    "- Linear Data Structures such as Stack,Queue can be easily implemeted using Linked list\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Idea?\n",
    "\n",
    "A linked list is a sequence of data elements, which are connected together via links. Each data element contains a connection to another data element in form of a pointer. Python does not have linked lists in its standard library. We implement the concept of linked lists using the concept of nodes.\n",

    "The following are the steps to create a SLL Data Structure:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Creating a node class**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Start the SLL implementation by creating a node class whose object will be used by another class\n",
    "    - The first part contains the actual data.\n",
    "    - The second part contains a link that points to the next node of the list that is the address of the next node.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Creating the LinkedList class**\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Then create a linkedlist class that will use the node object to pass the appropriate values to point to the next data elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Traversing the Linked List**\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Traverse the SLL by assigning the pointer to the next node to the current data element.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Inserting into the SLL**\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Inserting an element into the SLL. This involves reassigning the pointers from the existing nodes to the newly inserted node. This totally depends on whether the element is inserted at the begining, or at the middle, or at the end of the list.Now we have the following scenarios:\n",
    "    - Inserting at the Beginning of the Linked List\n",
    "    - Inserting at the End of the Linked List\n",
    "    - Inserting in between two Data Nodes\n",
    "    \n",
    "**Removing an Item form the SLL**\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Remove a particular node or element from the SLL by using the key for that node.\n",
    "    - This is done by finding the pointer to the previous node to this node.\n",
    "    - Then linking this previous node to the node following the to be deleted node.\n",
    "\n",
    "  \n",
    "Now that we know how the algorithm works, lets figure out how to code it.\n",
