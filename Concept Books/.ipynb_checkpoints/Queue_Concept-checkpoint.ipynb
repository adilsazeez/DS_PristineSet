    "### What is Queue?\n",
    "\n",
    "In computer science, a queue is a collection of entities that are maintained in a sequence and can be modified by the addition of entities at one end of the sequence and the removal of entities from the other end of the sequence. By convention, the end of the sequence at which elements are added is called the back, tail, or rear of the queue, and the end at which elements are removed is called the head or front of the queue, analogously to the words used when people line up to wait for goods or services. (Source: Wikipedia)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Queue?\n",
    "\n",
    "A queue is optimised for particular operations which may be used frequently in use cases where a queue comes handy, for example adding an object to the end of the queue and removing an object from the head of the queue.\n",
    "It is fast and flexible. \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Idea?\n",
    "\n",
    "A queue is a first-in first-out (FIFO) abstract data type that is heavily used in computing. Uses for queues involve anything where you want things to happen in the order that they were called, but where the computer can't keep up to speed. Eg. Keyboard Buffer, Printer Queue.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "In programming terms, putting an item in the queue is called an `EnQueue` and removing an item from the queue is called `DeQueue`\n",
    "\n",
    "The GIF shown above depicts the operations that a generic Queue data structure performs - `EnQueue` & `DeQueue`, only after checking whether Queue is full or empty.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a video of one more example. The video explains the workings of the Queue Data Structure in a more generic way implemented using python."

    "So how can we code a Queue Data Structure? Lets break it down. There are 7 fundamental building blocks of a Queue Data Structure-\n",
    "\n",
    "The following steps for Queue implementation are performed using a list.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Create a list**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Start the implementation by creating an empty list for queue operations\n",
    "    - any changes made to the queue will reflect on this list.\n",

    "**Define the Display function**\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Create a display() function that prints the list that is used to implement the queue.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Define the is_empty function**\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Create an is_empty() function that checks whether the queue is empty or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Define the EnQueue function**\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Create a enqueue() function that adds an element to the end of the queue.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Define the DeQueue function**\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Create a dequeue() function that removes an element from the front of the queue\n",
    "    - This step is performed only after checking whether the queue has items in it or not (before the dequeue operation is performed).\n",
    "    \n",
    "**Define the Peek function**\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Create a peek() function that returns the value of the front of the queue without deleting it.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Define the Size function**\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Create a size() function that returns the size of the queue based on the count of items inside it.\n",
